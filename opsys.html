Main memory är ju tomt när datorn startas och datorn behöver instruktioner från main memory för att något ska hända, därför har man gjort på detta vis. The program that is initially executed when the machine is turned on is called the boot loader, the instructions in the boot loader direct the CPU to transfer the operating system from its location into volatile area of main memory. </td>
